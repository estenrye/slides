# This rule is a performance optimization for tcp connections.
# TCP protocols will exchange many packets back and forth over the same
# connection.  This rule makes the assumption that if the first packet of the 
# connection is accepted as OK, then it stands to reason that all other packets
# received from established or related connections would also be marked OK.
# This allows us to short circuit the firewall rule execution for those
# packets.
